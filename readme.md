### Introduction ###

---

The following is my custom configuration for Counter Strike Global Offensive, having spent a considerable amount of time researching and compiling what I have found to be a solid foundation for a autoexec.  I typically update this configuration configuration every few months. 

---

**Things you will need to change for your own config**

* Adjust the sensitivity on line 334
* Select to enable or disable rawinput on line 336
* Change Video.txt options to whatever you prefer

---


View this autoexec as a good "frame work" and build upon it, feel free to tweak these settings to your liking, and be sure to contact me with any issues or bugs. 

The video.txt file is optimized for the highest fps performance and viability, feel free to modify it to your personal preferences. 


---

### Notes ###

---

**Rates:**

Rates are configured for 128 tick rate servers however will scale down for lower tick rate. 
<br />

**Raw Input and Mouse Acceleration:**

Based on my research and first-hand experience, the in game rawinput 'm_rawinput 0' has been disabled. You can read more about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1f8km4/csgo_raw_input_faulty/), I recommend you set up the [The MarkC Windows 8 + 7 Mouse Acceleration Fix](http://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2010/03/markc-windows-7-mouse-acceleration-fix.html) to get a true 1:1 pointer response. 

**Crosshair Customization:**

I have included my basic crosshair however you can replace it with your own. 



---

### Installation ###

---


<br />

<ol>
<li>The autoexec.cfg file will need to be uploaded to the following location on your local drive: 
<br />
'Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg'
</li>

<br />
<li>Launch game and open the developer console by hitting the ~ button </li>
<br />
<li>Input the following command on game start up: exec autoexec </li>
<br />
<li>Restart game, make modifications to options and autoexec.cfg as you like. </li>
<br />
</ol>
